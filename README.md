Database Manager

This is a simple Java project that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage data in a players table. The application allows you to perform basic (Create, Read and Delete) operations via Java methods using JDBC. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database and executes SQL queries to add players to the database and retrieve all players.

The project doesn't use any frameworks like Spring Boot or Hibernate, and it is intended to showcase the use of JDBC for database interaction.

Features
Add Players: Allows you to insert new players into the players table.

Remove Players: By choosing correct console option and enter id of player, this functionality will remove him from database.

Get All Players: Fetches all player records from the players table.
